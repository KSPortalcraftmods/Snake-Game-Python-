(All of its dependcies)

Please note there is a bug were sometimes you just die all of a sudden. 

The only diffrence between reg slow , and fast is this line of code.

 while flag:  
        pygame.time.delay(75)  
        clock.tick(5)  

Reg: Normal speeds , and colours. Little input lag and ok in smoothness

Slow: Slow speed , differnt colours. Massive input and kind of bugg , Not Smooth


Fast: Fast Speeds , differnt colours. No input lag , kind of buggy. Very smooth.
